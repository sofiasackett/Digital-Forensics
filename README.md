### IT Consultancy Report

My IT Consultancy Report showcases my ability to analyze the network configuration of a simulated company. I explored interception methods, including hubs, network TAPs, and SPAN configurations on managed switches. Additionally, I delved into the legal aspects of intercepting network data, demonstrating a well-rounded understanding of ethical considerations in the cybersecurity domain. I also  present a network diagram and a comprehensive report on the analysis of an unknown PCAP file using Wireshark. My focus was on identifying potential attacks and understanding network behavior, showcasing my analytical skills and attention to detail.

### PCAP File Analysis

I demonstrate my expertise in analyzing PCAP files using Wireshark and Pivot tables in Excel to look for abnormalities in extremely large data sets. The analysis provides insights into potential attacks, showcasing my ability to interpret complex network data and draw meaningful conclusions.

### Linux Live Incident Response

I developed a Bash script for Linux live incident response, highlighting my scripting capabilities for collecting both volatile and non-volatile data. This script serves as a practical tool for preserving critical data during incident response scenarios.

### Live Incident Response Infographics

I created infographics that visually guide the live incident response process for both Windows and Linux machines. This demonstrates my ability to communicate complex technical processes effectively and make them accessible to a broader audience.

### System Information Collection Batch Script

My batch file simplifies the process of collecting system information, providing a streamlined solution for capturing essential details about the system environment. This showcases my practical approach to automation in digital forensics tasks.

### Malware Behavior Analysis Report

In the Malware Behavior Analysis Report, I conducted static and dynamic analysis of malware on a victim Windows machine. The report details the environment setup and showcases my skills in malware analysis, utilizing a REMnux virtual machine as a fake DNS and HTTP server.

### Conclusion
I invite you to explore the depth of my digital forensics skills showcased in this portfolio. Each project reflects my commitment to continuous improvement and my passion for contributing to the cybersecurity landscape.
